# 0x0A. Python - Inheritance
---
## Description

This project in the High Level Programming series is about:
* What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
* What is a subclass
* How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
* When can an instance have new attributes
* How to inherit class from another
* How to define a class with multiple base classes
* What is the default class every class inherit from
* How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
* Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
* What is the purpose of inheritance
* What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions

## Files

0-lookup.py |  function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object
1-my_list.py, tests/1-my_list.txt | class MyList that inherits from list and text file for testing
2-is_same_class.py | function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class ; otherwise False
3-is_kind_of_class.py | function that returns True if the object is an instance of, or if the object is an instance of a class that inherited from, the specified class ; otherwise False
4-inherits_from.py | function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ; otherwise False
5-base_geometry.py | an empty class BaseGeometry
6-base_geometry.py | class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py)
7-base_geometry.py, tests/7-base_geometry.txt | class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py) and test file
8-rectangle.py | a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py)
9-rectangle.py | a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py)
10-square.py | a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)
11-square.py | a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py)
100-my_int.py | a class MyInt that inherits from int

0x0A-python-inheritance | Main Python files
tests | Main test files for doctest

## More Info for Python programs
* All Python files is PEP 8(version 1.7) formatted
* All modules, classes and functions(inside and outside a class) have documentations
* Python Scripts - first line of every file is exactly be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3 and executable

## Python Test Cases
* All tests should be executed by using this command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
* All test files is inside a folder tests
* All test files is text files (extension: .txt)
